# Rails Engine


### What?
  Module 3 project, focused on building and testing an API in rails that serves up Etsy data from CSVs. End points can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

### Notes:
  I experimented with some meta-programming techniques to build dynamic controllers and models, which was pretty fun.
